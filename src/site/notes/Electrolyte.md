## Electrolyte
- An electrolyte is a substance that conducts electricity through the movement of ions, but not through the movement of electrons : this includes most soluble salts, acids, and bases, dissolved in a polar solvent like water
- Electrically, the electrolyte is neutral
- Gasses like HCl can also act as electrolytes, as well as molten salts

$\mu_{\mathrm{i}}={\frac{q_{\mathrm{i}}D_{\mathrm{i}}}{k_{\mathrm{B}}T}}$ 

## Water in Salt Electrolytes (WiSE) for aqueous batteries
- Worked on by Jean-Marie Tarascon at the Collège de France

### Aqueous electrolyte additives
