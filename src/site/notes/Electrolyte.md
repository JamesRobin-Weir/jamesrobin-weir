- An electrolyte is a substance that conducts electricity through the movement of ions, but not through the movement of electrons : this includes most soluble salts, acids, and bases, dissolved in a polar solvent like water
- Electrically, the electrolyte is neutral
- Gasses like HCl can also act as electrolytes, as well as molten salts
