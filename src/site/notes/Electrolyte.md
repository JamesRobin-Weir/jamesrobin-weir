## Electrolyte
- An electrolyte is a substance that conducts electricity through the movement of ions, but not through the movement of electrons : this includes most soluble salts, acids, and bases, dissolved in a polar solvent like water. Such a substance is called an ionic conductor.
- The electrolyte is electrically neutral
- Gasses like HCl can also act as electrolytes, as well as molten salts
- Solid state batteries use solid ionic conductors as opposed to liquid electrolytes

## Water in Salt Electrolytes (WiSE) for aqueous batteries
- See the work of Jean-Marie Tarascon at the Collège de France

### Aqueous electrolyte additives

Many different electrolytes and electrolytic additives can be used for ZIBs at different potentials and pH values.
