## DÃ©fintions
- Electric polarisability : relative tendency of a charge distribution, like the electron cloud of an atom or molecule, to be distorted from its normal shape by an external electric field, measured a the quotient of the induced dipole moment over the electric field strength $\alpha=\dfrac{|p|}{|E|}$ 
## Leakage in electronics
- Leakage is the gradual transfer of electrical energy across a boundary normally viewed as insulating, such as the spontaneous discharge of a charged capacitor or magnetic coupling of a transformer with other components

## Leakage in electrohydrodynamics
- perfect conductors : mercury or water
- perfect dielectrics : apolar liquids such as benzene that are excellent insulators
- poorly conducting liquids = leaky dielectrics

**Regular dielectrics**
- no loosely bound, or free, electrons that may drift through the material under an electric field
- instead electrons slightly shift from their average equilibrium positions, causing dielectric polarisation

### Notes
- electrokinetics, deals with the behaviour of charged particles in aqueous electrolytes (Saville 1977, Russel et al 1989)
- there are significant differences between the behaviour of electrolytes and leaky dielectrics
