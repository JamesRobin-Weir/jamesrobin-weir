## In electronics
- Leakage is the gradual transfer of electrical energy across a boundary normally viewed as insulating, such as the spontaneous discharge of a charged capacitor or magnetic coupling of a transformer with other components

## In electrohydrodynamics
- perfect conductors : mercury or water
- perfect dielectrics : apolar liquids such as benzene
- poorly conducting liquids = leaky dielectrics

### Notes
- electrokinetics, deals with the behavior of charged particles in aqueous electrolytes (Saville 1977, Russel et al 1989)
- there are significant differences between the behavior of electrolytes and leaky dielectrics
