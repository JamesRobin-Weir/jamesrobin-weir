# Webinaire : Electrode & Electrolyte Engineering in Aqueous Zinc-ion Batter

Speaker :  Professor Husam AlShareef
### Why chose ZIBs ?
- **Use case of ZIBs** = low-cost, long life batteries for grid storage (not for high energy density applications like )
#### Advantages of Zinc Batteries
- Much safer and more ecofriendly than lithium batteries
- Abundant and therefore cheap ($2/kg instead of $19/kg lithium)
- Zinc is multivalent so there is higher potential charge density
- It also has a similar ionic radius to lithium
- It has a suitable redox potential (-0.78V VS ESH), which also makes it stable in aqueous electrolytes which are cheaper and less polluting

#### History of Zinc Batteries
- **1882**: Alkaline Zn-MnO2 single use batteries
- **1986** : Zn-MnO2ZnSO4 rechargeable battery
- **2010s** : Stable zinc anodes

### Issues in current ZIB technology
#### At the Cathode
- Dissolution
- Structural stability
- Surface by-products
#### At the Anode
- Zn corrosion (due to basic electrolytes)
- Surface by-products (ZHS at higher pH)
- Irreversible Hydrogen evolution reaction ($2H^+ + 2e^− → H_{2}$)
- Dendrite formation (risking short circuiting or rupturing the cell)

#### With the Electrolyte
- Proton intercalation at cathode
- Electrolyte consumption at anode
- Undesired [[Weirsite/SEI\|SEI]] chemistry

### Chemical equations at play

There are multiple sets of chemical reactions at play, depending on pH and the imposed potential, as illustrated by the following figure :

### HER and OER parasitic reactions

The evolution reactions of hydrogen at the cathode and oxygen at the anode are parasitic in nature, decreasing the overall efficiency and potentially damaging the battery cell. Their reaction equations are illustrated below :
