# Typical Mines Télécom Presentation

Good morning, my name is VOTRE NOM and I am a second year student in a preparatory physics and chemistry class at the NOM DU LYCÉE school in NOM DE LA VILLE. In addition, I also follow optional LANGUAGE/MUSIC/SPORT classes at NAME OF INSTITUTION.

In highschool I chose Maths and joint Physics and Chemistry as my main subjects, and took HISTORY-GEOPOLITICS/BIOLOGY AND GEOLOGICAL SCIENCES as the first year option as I was interested in learning more about international relations. I also chose EXPERT MATHS/ADDITIONAL MATHS as an optional class, and participated in my school's THEATRE/MUSIC/PHOTOGRAPHY club.

Now I chose to prepare for engineering schools as I am naturally enjoy maths, physics and chemistry, but more specifically because I wish to work towards a career in the RENEWABLE ENERGY/TELECOMMUNICATIONS/CYBER SECURITY sector. I believe it's now more important than ever for people to get involved in SAFEGUARDING THE FUTURE OF THE EARTH/SECURING THEIR DATA WITH THE ADVENT OF QUANTUM ENCRYPTION DECODING, and SECURING CLEAN DURABLE ENERGY SOURCES/DEVELOPING NEW QUANTUM ALGORITHMS is a central factor of that. I also hope to someday work in COUNTRY/COMPANY because of REASON, for example REASON EXAMPLE. 

Now outside of study time, I go ROCK CLIMBING/SWIMMING/CYCLING DAILY/EVERY WEEK during the work week, to clear my head and improve my sleep quality. I also decided this year to CYCLE TWO AND FROM SCHOOL/READ FOR 20 MINUTES BEFORE BED. I pursue other extracurricular activities such as MUSIC/CULTURAL ACTIVITY, as I PLAY PIANO/GO TO TO SEE MUSEUM EXHIBITIONS when I have the time.

ANECDOTE PERSONNELLE SUR VOTRE FAMILLE : e.g. My family and I actually arrived in France from Australia a few years ago, as my mother secured a position working in a french art gallery. This is part of the reason I wish to work in Australia in the future, but regardless, I believe I only benefit from having a family atmosphere deeply plunged in the arts, which has given me a more multi-faced world view, and encouraged my pursuit of languages even during this very intense course.

It is for these reasons, because of my motivation to my personal projects and dedication to my studies in all subjects, that I think a school like ENSTA BRETAGNE OR MINES D'ALÉS among others in the Mines Telecom group, which have excellent MARINE RENEWABLE ENERGIES AND AN ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT COURSE would be a great fit for me. Thank you for your time
