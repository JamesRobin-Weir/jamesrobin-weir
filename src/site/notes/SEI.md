## What is an SEI (Solid Electrolyte Interphase) ?
During LMB operation, an interphase passivation film (SEI) is formed between Li metal phase and electrolyte phase by spontaneous chemical reactions and electrochemical reductions of the electrolyte. 

SEIs are responsible for not only impeding the continuous parasitic reactions between the electrolyte and Li electrode, but also influencing the deposition and stripping behaviours of Li. 

Despite their significance, SEIs are not well understood due to their low thickness, complex structure, heterogeneous composition, and dynamic nature (spatially and temporally dynamic in morphology and composition).

## Caracterisation
- allows for influencing the Li deposition morphology and the cycle life of LMB
- prevents continuous reactions between the non-aqueous electrolyte and the alkali metal anode
- Caractérisés par : electronic conduction, ionic conduction, stability, and mechanical properties
